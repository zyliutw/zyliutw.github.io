I completed my second Ph.D. at Graduate School of Natural Science & Technology, Kanazawa University, Japan (advised by **[Prof. Masahiro Mambo](https://iseclab.ec.t.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/en/mambo/index.html){:.welcome}**). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S.Eng. in Computer Science at National Chengchi University, Taiwan under the supervision of **[Prof. Raylin Tso](https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/islab/advisor.html){:.welcome}** and my B.Eng. in Computer Science at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.

My primary research focus lies in the field of applied cryptography, with particular emphasis on areas such as searchable encryption and identity-based encryption. Furthermore, I also focus on lattice-based cryptosystems, which are likely to be the critical cryptography of the next century due to their resistance to quantum computer attacks.
