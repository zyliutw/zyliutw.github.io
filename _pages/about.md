I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Information Managemen at National Central University, Taiwan.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at National Chengchi University, Taiwan, under the supervision of **[Prof. Raylin Tso](https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/islab/advisor.html){:.welcome}**. Additionally, I earned another Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Natural Science & Technology at Kanazawa University, Japan, under the supervision of **[Prof. Masahiro Mambo](https://iseclab.ec.t.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/en/mambo/index.html){:.welcome}** (double-degree program).

My primary research focus lies in the field of applied cryptography, with particular emphasis on areas such as searchable encryption and identity-based encryption. Furthermore, I also focus on lattice-based cryptosystems, which are likely to be the critical cryptography of the next century due to their resistance to quantum computer attacks.
