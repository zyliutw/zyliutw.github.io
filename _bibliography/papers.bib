To protect sensitive data privacy in DSS, anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) is a promising approach, enabling encryption using a recipient’s identity as a public key, while preventing identity and data leaks out of ciphertexts. As complete anonymity risks abuse and illegal usage, Blazy et al. introduced the notion called anonymous IBE with traceable identities (AIBET) at ARES’19, allowing users with tracing keys to identify recipients from ciphertexts. Unfortunately, existing AIBET schemes lack tracing key delegation and only consider security in weaker models (i.e., selective-identity attacks and chosen-plaintext attacks), posing risks of inconvenience and user privacy leaks. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion called anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption with delegated traceability (AHIBEDT) for DSS. We formalize its syntax and define security notions in stronger models (i.e., adaptive-identity attacks and chosen-ciphertext attacks). In addition, we demonstrate that a concrete AHIBEDT scheme can be simply obtained from a hierarchical IBE scheme and a one-time signature scheme. The comparison results indicate that, despite a substantial increase in communication and computational costs, our approach achieves better security and functionality.}

  abstract={With the rise of cloud computing, multi-user scenarios have become a common setting for data sharing nowadays. The conservative security notion might not be sufficient for such a data sharing model. As a response to this challenge, there has been significant research targeting security against receiver selective-opening (RSO) attacks. However, we found that none of these studies discuss RSO security specifically for predicate encryption (PE)—an encryption mechanism naturally designed for multi-user data sharing. This manuscript first formalizes the RSO security for PE. We then present a generic PE construction that achieves RSO security based on the simulation-based definition. Our work also features several instantiations for various predicate families, including attribute-based encryption for the monotone span program, which is known as one of the most expressive PE.}
